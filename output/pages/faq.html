What is a Validator?
<i class="fa fa-angle-down drop-down-icon" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

<p style="display:none">
    The role of validators is to run a full-node and participate in consensus by broadcasting votes which contain cryptographic signatures signed by their private key. Validators commit new blocks in the blockchain and receive rewards in exchange for their work. They must also participate in governance by voting on proposals. Validators are weighted according to their total stake.
</p>

<h3 class="faq">
Proof of Stake
<i class="fa fa-angle-down drop-down-icon" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

<p style="display:none">
    Proof of Stake (PoS) is a category of consensus algorithms for public blockchains that depend on a validator's economic stake in the network. In PoS-based public blockchains, a set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the next block, and the weight of each validator's vote depends on the size of its deposit (i.e. stake). Advantages of PoS include security, reduced risk of centralization, and energy efficiency. Transaction validators receive rewards in proportion to the amount of their “stake” in the network.
</p>

<h3 class="faq">
Proof of Authority 
<i class="fa fa-angle-down drop-down-icon" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

<p style="display:none">
    Proof of Authority (PoA) is a category of consensus algorithms for public blockchains that delivers instant transactions through a consensus mechanism based on identity as a stake. In PoA-based networks, transactions and blocks are validated by approved accounts, known as validators. Validators run software allowing them to put transactions in blocks. The process is automated and does not require validators to be constantly monitoring their computers. It, however, does require maintaining the computer (the node) uncompromised. 
<p>

<h3 class="faq">
Delegator vs Validator
<i class="fa fa-angle-down drop-down-icon" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

<p style="display:none">
    A validator has an active key involved in signing votes in the consensus protocol. A validator must also have some tokens in a security deposit. Since there will only be a limitted number of validators, other token holders can delegate to the validators, thereby contributing to the economic security of the system by putting their funds on the line if the validator misbehaves. In return, they earn a share of the transaction fees and any inflationary rewards.
    <br><br>
    Delegators are never validators. If a validator wishes to delegate, they need to do so with their free and unbonded tokens.
