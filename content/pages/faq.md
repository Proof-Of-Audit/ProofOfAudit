Why should validators in blockchain networks be audited?
<i class="fa fa-angle-down drop-down-icon" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

<p style="display:none">
	As a validator, audits help you bring in more delegators, providing a level of protection and serving as a ‘verification badge’ to your delegators that their stake is safe.

How do audits protect me as a delegator?

<p style="display:none">
	As a delegator, security audit allows you to make informed decisions. It provides increased confidence where you delegate your stake and helps you stay safe from malicious attacks.

<p style="display:none">
	Proof of Stake and Proof of Authority blockchains rely heavily on validators operational competence. The failure of a small number of operations can bring the network to a halt requiring outside of protocol intervention and slowing down the service.

	Moreover, validators with high security risk can build up large stakes by charging very low fees to delegators, causing a race to the bottom in terms of security, which can compromise stored funds and information integrity.

</p>

<h3 class="faq">
How comprehensive are your audits?
<i class="fa fa-angle-down drop-down-icon" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

<p style="display:none">
	Audits evaluate validator track record, security level of their hardware, availability, and protection against malicious attacks.  Audits can range from the basic to the comprehensive depending on the needs of the validator. Three level of services are being provided - Basic, Standard, and Expert. Basic report provides a publicly available security score of your current setup. Standard and Expert services go into further detail, providing extensive feedback and recommendations for improvement.

What is the level of competence of your auditors?

	Zaki Manian has been working on the problem of validator security for several years. He helped design the best practices in the Cosmos Network and is one of the operators of the iqlusion.io validator. Through Proof of Audit, he is making this experience available to both validators and delegators.

Does Proof of Audit itself become a security risk to the network?

<p style="display:none">
	Non-Disclosure Agreement is signed with each client.  Customers can be confident that any information disclosing details of their setup is kept confidential. These details are never disclosed in public reports but only serve as a basis for an accurate evaluation.

	After the audit is complete, Proof of Audit destroys any information received from the client in order to minimize the value that can be obtained by compromising proof-of-audit.com.

<!-- <h3 class="faq">
What is a Validator?
<i class="fa fa-angle-down drop-down-icon" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

<p style="display:none">
	The role of validators is to run a full-node and participate in consensus by broadcasting votes which contain cryptographic signatures signed by their private key. Validators commit new blocks in the blockchain and receive rewards in exchange for their work. They must also participate in governance by voting on proposals. Validators are weighted according to their total stake.
</p>


<h3 class="faq">
Proof of Stake
<i class="fa fa-angle-down drop-down-icon" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

<p style="display:none">
	Proof of Stake (PoS) is a category of consensus algorithms for public blockchains that depend on a validator's economic stake in the network. In PoS-based public blockchains, a set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the next block, and the weight of each validator's vote depends on the size of its deposit (i.e. stake). Advantages of PoS include security, reduced risk of centralization, and energy efficiency. Transaction validators receive rewards in proportion to the amount of their “stake” in the network.
</p>

<h3 class="faq">
Proof of Authority 
<i class="fa fa-angle-down drop-down-icon" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

<p style="display:none">
	Proof of Authority (PoA) is a category of consensus algorithms for public blockchains that delivers instant transactions through a consensus mechanism based on identity as a stake. In PoA-based networks, transactions and blocks are validated by approved accounts, known as validators. Validators run software allowing them to put transactions in blocks. The process is automated and does not require validators to be constantly monitoring their computers. It, however, does require maintaining the computer (the node) uncompromised.

<h3 class="faq">
Delegator vs Validator
<i class="fa fa-angle-down drop-down-icon" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>

<p style="display:none">
	A validator has an active key involved in signing votes in the consensus protocol. A validator must also have some tokens in a security deposit. Since there will only be a limitted number of validators, other token holders can delegate to the validators, thereby contributing to the economic security of the system by putting their funds on the line if the validator misbehaves. In return, they earn a share of the transaction fees and any inflationary rewards.
	<br><br>
	Delegators are never validators. If a validator wishes to delegate, they need to do so with their free and unbonded tokens.
